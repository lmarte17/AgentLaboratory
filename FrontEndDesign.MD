Below is a conceptual design for a web-based frontend that can wrap around and interact with AgentLaboratory. It focuses on usability and clarity, letting your user quickly understand and customize each phase of the research workflow. I’ve included high-level UI components, how they integrate with the back end, and ideas for how you might implement them.

## High-Level UI Features

1. **Landing / Overview Page**  
   - **Purpose:** Provide an at-a-glance overview of the entire research workflow, plus an entry point to start or resume an existing project.  
   - **Key Components:**
     - **Start New Project** button: Prompts user for a research topic (and possibly advanced settings).  
     - **Resume Project** button: Shows a list of previously saved states or “checkpoints.”  
     - **AgentLaboratory Explanation**: A quick summary of the system so users know what it does.

2. **Project Dashboard**  
   - **Purpose:** The central location that users see after starting or loading a project.  
   - **Key Components:**
     - **Project Title & High-Level Actions:** The top banner could include the research topic, a “Save Project” button, and an “Export Project” or “Download Results” button.  
     - **Phases Progress Bar**: A horizontal (or vertical) step indicator for the four main phases:
       1. Literature Review  
       2. Plan Formulation  
       3. Experimentation  
       4. Results Interpretation & Report Writing  
     - Each item in the progress bar can be clickable, letting the user jump directly to that phase’s UI.

3. **Phase-Specific Panels**  
   - **Purpose:** Provide a specialized view for each of the four main phases.  
   - **Key Components Common to All Phase Views:**  
     - **Agent Dialogue** or “Conversation” Section: Where the agent’s messages can appear in a chat-like style.  
     - **Human Feedback** text area: Let the user type feedback if they’re in “copilot/human-in-loop mode.”  
     - **History & Logs** button: A collapsible panel that shows prior commands, code outputs, and steps.  
     - **Actions** area: The main way to control or re-run tasks within a phase, e.g., “Run again,” “Accept & Move on,” etc.

   ### A. Literature Review Panel
   - **Key Visuals / Components:**
     - **Search Queries**: Let the user input or refine search queries that the agent can run against arXiv or Hugging Face (if relevant for the lit review).  
     - **Paper Summaries Table**: Display search results or the papers added so far—title, summary, ID, etc.  
     - **Agent-Added Summaries**: As soon as AgentLaboratory performs `SUMMARY`, `FULL_TEXT`, or `ADD_PAPER` commands, show them in a running list.  
     - **Phase Navigation**: Only unlocks “Next Phase (Plan Formulation)” if the user or agent decides enough papers have been summarized.

   ### B. Plan Formulation Panel
   - **Key Visuals / Components:**
     - **Draft Plan Window**: Displays the plan as it evolves from the agent’s conversation with the user.  
     - **Chat / Dialogue Panel**: So the user can discuss with the “Postdoc” and “PhD” agents.  
     - **Submit Plan** button: Once the agent proposes a `PLAN` block, show it in the UI. The user can choose to “Accept” or “Request Revisions.”  
     - **Phase Navigation**: Once accepted, the user can proceed to “Data Preparation.”

   ### C. Experimentation Panel (Data Preparation + Running Experiments)
   You can unify “Data Preparation” and “Running Experiments” into separate tabs or a single integrated experience.  

   **Data Preparation**  
   - **Key Visuals / Components:**
     - **Proposed Code**: The agent’s Python code that loads or preprocesses a dataset.  
       - Possibly a code editor that can highlight syntax, with the option to “Execute” or “Reject & Modify.”  
     - **Console Output**: Show the agent’s logs or error messages from code execution.  
     - **HF Datasets**: If the user or agent triggers a Hugging Face dataset search (`SEARCH_HF`), display results in a table (like with the literature review).
     - **Submit Code**: If the code runs successfully, store it as the final data preparation script.

   **Running Experiments**  
   - **Key Visuals / Components:**
     - **Experiment Logs**: A scrollable console output that shows the agent’s training logs, accuracy, and other experiment metrics.  
     - **Figures / Plots**: If the code produced new images or graphs, show them in a gallery.  
     - **Final “Best Code”** area: Display the best final script from the MLESolver, plus any score or metric.  
     - **Re-run / Retry** button: If the agent’s code fails or the user wants to refine hyperparameters.

   ### D. Results Interpretation & Report Writing Panel
   - **Key Visuals / Components:**
     - **Interpretation Discussion**: Similar chat interface for the user to see agent’s interpretation or request clarifications.  
     - **Draft Report**: Show the agent’s LaTeX output in a read-only area. If you enable PDF compilation, embed a live PDF viewer.  
     - **Compile / Refresh**: When the agent finalizes the LaTeX, recompile behind the scenes, show a PDF preview.  
     - **Download PDF / .tex**: Provide quick ways for the user to export.

4. **Notifications & Modals**  
   - Whenever the agent is performing an operation (searching for datasets, generating code, etc.), you can show a toast or small notification “Agent is searching for datasets…” so the user knows tasks are running.  
   - For errors or exceptions, show either a toast or pop-up with logs to debug.

5. **Global Chat vs. Phase-Specific Chat**  
   Some designers prefer a single global chat for the entire workflow. Others prefer each phase to have its own “mini-chat.” The crucial point is that the user can see the context and conversation that has occurred for each phase. Keeping them separate can reduce confusion, but unifying them can feel more “conversational.” Either approach is fine; just be consistent.

6. **User Settings / Options**  
   - LLM Model Settings: If you want advanced users to specify model temperature or max tokens.  
   - Language: If you support multi-language usage, let them pick a UI language or an agent language.  
   - Checkpoint Frequency: Optionally set how often the system automatically saves.  

7. **Summary of Usage / Cost**  
   - Because AgentLaboratory provides approximate cost tracking, you could show a little “Estimated Cost: $x.xx” at the top of the dashboard, updating after each agent interaction.

8. **Saves & Checkpoints**  
   - Provide a straightforward “Load / Save” interface. The user can see different timestamps or phases that were saved. Possibly store these in a backend database or local disk.

## Possible Implementation Outline

Below is a rough technical outline for a React + Flask (or any Python-based backend) approach. You can adapt it to Vue/Angular or a different backend if preferred:

1. **Frontend** (React):
   - **App Layout**: Use a router to switch between pages: `LandingPage`, `ProjectDashboard`, `PhasePanel` (with sub-routes for each step).
   - **Redux / Context**: Keep global state about the current “Lab session,” including the conversation logs, the code scripts, the final outputs, etc.
   - **Components**:
     - `PhaseProgressBar`, `ChatBox`, `CodeEditor`, `FiguresGallery`, `PapersTable`, etc.
   - **Styling**: Use a robust component library (e.g., Material UI or Chakra UI) to make the interface clean and consistent.

2. **Backend** (Flask or FastAPI):
   - **Endpoints** for each major action:
     - `/api/new-project` → POST with a research topic and advanced settings. Returns an internal project ID.
     - `/api/load-project` → GET or POST with a project ID to restore from local disk or database.
     - `/api/agent-message` → POST with the project ID, current phase, user message, etc. The backend calls the relevant AgentLaboratory method, returns the response and any logs.
     - `/api/save-project` → POST that triggers an internal “pickle” or database save of the current session.
     - `/api/compile-latex` → Optionally for generating a PDF from the final .tex.  

3. **How the Frontend Interacts**:
   - Each time the user sends a message (e.g., “Ok, let’s do a new dataset search” or “Accept this plan”), the frontend calls `/api/agent-message`, passing the user message and the project ID.  
   - The backend uses the stored state to continue the conversation, updates the relevant agent (PhD, Postdoc, etc.), and returns text or code to the client.
   - The client receives the output, updates the UI (for example, if the agent returns code, show it in the code editor; if the agent returns a plan, show it in the plan draft area).

4. **Handling Code Execution**:
   - If you want the user to be able to run code from the frontend, have a route like `/api/run-code` that executes the Python code using the same approach MLESolver uses. Return the console logs or error messages to the user in real time.

5. **Error Handling & Logs**:
   - Store logs in a rolling text buffer or database for each request. The frontend can display them if the user clicks “Show Logs.”

6. **Deployment**:
   - Place the Python backend on a server (AWS, Azure, Heroku, etc.) and the React/Vue/Angular UI as a static site.  
   - For local usage, the user can just run `npm run dev` or `yarn start` for the React app, and `python app.py` for the Flask backend. They’d go to `http://localhost:3000` (or similar) to use the UI.
